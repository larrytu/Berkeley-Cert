# Customer Coupon Acceptance Report

## Overview
This report provides the highlights of my analysis on customers who have accepted coupons and those who did not. The goal is to find out what factors causes people to accept the coupon and what causes people to not accept the coupons.

## Summary of Findings

### Demographics
- **Age**: Drivers who were older than 25 were more likely to accept the coupons. This could be because of the experience gap. Younger people could be less responsible with money which results in them not gravitating towards coupons.
- **Kids**: I found that drivers with kids have mixed reactions. It mainly depends on the type of coupon. For example drivers with kids as passengers would not choose the bar coupon due to the child not being old enough to enter, but drivers with kids are more likely to get carryout coupons due to the normally lower prices and ease of access.

### Occupation
- Customers in professional roles showed a higher coupon acceptance rate. In contrast, the students and unemployed were less likely to accept coupons.

### Income Levels
- Surprisingly, drivers with lower incomes were not as inclined to accepting the coupons. This could be the result of them not having more disposable income like the higher earners have. 

### Marital Status
- Married customers had a higher coupon acceptance rate. This could be because of companies creating more family oriented deals.

### Frequency of Visits
- I found that drivers who has been to an establishment less were more inclined to accept the coupon. The reason could be that the drivers didn't have the motivation to go to the restaurant or without the coupon, the establishment would be out of their price range. People who already frequent a place are people who could more easily afford to go.

## Conclusion
To conclude, the acceptance of coupons varies by gender, age, and marital status. Depending on the type of coupon, some drivers are more likely to choose a certain coupon over another.
